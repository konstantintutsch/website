<h2>Fediverse</h2>

<p>
If you just want to quickly share a though of yours with me, this is the place. The instance is hosted on my Raspberry Pi.<br>
<br>
Just tag me: <span class="mention">@konstantin@social.konstantintutsch.de</span>
</p>

<h2>E-Mail</h2>

<p>
You, of course, can contact me via email. I'll respond not as fast, but still fairly quickly.<br>
<br>
Reach me at {% include social.html url="mailto:hey@konstantintutsch.de" name="hey@konstantintutsch.de" %}
</p>
