You, of course, can contact me via email. I'll respond fairly quickly. E-Mail is also my preferred communication method for this blog. You can reach me at {% include social.html url="mail" name=site.email %}
</p>

<p>
In case you want to encrypt your email, here's my <a href="{% link assets/gpg.asc %}">public GPG key</a>. Use the mail address encoded to the file. The one above is a changing alias so I can prevent spam, there is no GPG key for it.
