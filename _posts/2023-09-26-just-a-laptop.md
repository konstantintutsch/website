## Not just a laptop

I've been using multiple monitors since basically forever, it gave me space to put windows on and I didn't need to think about organizing them. A bad decision in retrospect: there were lots of distracting windows.

## ~~Not~~ just a laptop

I just mentioned that multiple monitors were a risk for distraction. And I therefore removed them.

{% include image.html file="Laptop_Wall.jpg" alt="A laptop and a plant on a white table in front of a white wall" caption="It's not as bad as it looks." %}

This really help me to work focused for a lot longer without short disruptions. And there's also a way smaller obstacle to work from somewhere else than my desk.

## Conclusion

To reach a conclusion, this might really help some people.

You may just try it. There's not a lot of effort in doing so, except when your cable management is not so neat ðŸ˜‰
