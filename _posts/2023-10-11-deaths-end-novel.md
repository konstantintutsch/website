This is the third and last book of the trilogy “Remembrance of Earth’s Past”. But before you continue, read my posts about book [one]({% link _posts/2023-10-07-the-three-body-problem-novel.md %}) and [two]({% link _posts/2023-10-08-the-dark-forest-novel.md %}) so you fully understand my opinion and thoughts.

The book added even more to the "puzzel" than the other two books. And these "puzzel pieces" were *even* more fundamental to the trilogy's world. But sadly, some of these ideas where a bit too far from what would make sense. There are of course things that aren't scientifical at all, but they are well integrated into the story. Towards the end of this final book though, a few details occurred not accomplishing that integration.

But overall, the trilogy combined makes these exaggerations fade away. In the end, my conclusion on this trilogy is pretty simple: **read it**.
