For those who don't know what *Do Not Disturb* (DND) is, it lets you basically switch of notifications and calls for your phone.

You can add exceptions for apps or contacts who should still be noticable or you may want to get a call if someone calls you twice in a short interval. But let's be honest, you won't get a lot of important calls and you can easily let most text messages wait for a few hours.

*But what are the theoretical benefits?*

- more focus, less distractions
- decreasing stress
- less screen time, healthier

There are of course more, but they aren't important for the context of this post.

I had been thinking about decreasing my alertness to notifications and my phone in general for some time now.

But I completely ignored, that DND existed. I never even had that in mind as a solution.

I then saw a great *german* YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/9dwCKOJHh9U) about useful routines by the ex-Facebook employee and now productivity YouTuber [Niklas Steenfatt](https://niklassteenfatt.com/).

It not only made me aware of the possibility, but he also explained why it shouldn't be a problem to actually keep it turned on.

After I'd watched the video, I thought about it some more, and in the end, decided to actually try it. I started on Monday and it is Friday evening now.

At the beginning, I was always worried to miss something. This was an unrational though and I didn't miss out on anything actually. I also noticed, that I started to not always look on my phone, when I was waiting somewhere. My sleep improved too and I stopped to look at my phone when waking up. I still turned the alarm off though ðŸ˜‰

All this has proven to me, that I should continue to keep DND actived.

I would really like to know, what you think about all this. And I can only recommend, that you turn on Do Not Disturb too ðŸ˜„
