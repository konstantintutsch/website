title: "A single webserver serving multiple domains"

## My setup and the importance to me

So, I'm pretty sure that an introduction is always helpful.

I've a got Raspberry Pi, 8G memory and 4 cores @ 1.8GHz, running at home. It was used for **only** a single service with a web interface.

I have to use a reverse proxy on some VPS, because the router I'm using isn't reliable with allowing port 80 and 443 from the outside for some reason.

I always wanted to use my Raspberry Pi for more, but only if the services looked "normal" from the outside, that is: no special ports needed to access them, just a simple subdomain.

## My (not so) special discovery

What I realized wasn't that surprising after all. I saw a video about a homeserver and that all the services had their own local domains. But how?

That isn't different from domain names on the internet. So I must be able to reproduce it and my "selfhosting dream" would come true!

I remembered that a webserver also knows which domain the client accessed / typed into the URL bar. A quick search, about how the Nginx webserver handles such, gave me the solution: in an Nginx configuration file for a site, you always specify the `server_name` parameter with the hosts' domain.

But if I point two domains, lets just say example1.com and example1.com to my VPS, creating two `server {}`s with different values in the `server_name` but listening on the same port, each of those domains would get it's own unique website.

This is how it could look like. Each configuration has their respective site.

**example1.com**

```
server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  listen [::]:443 ssl;
  server_name example1.com;
 
  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example1.com/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example1.com/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
  include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

  location / {
    proxy_pass https://router:60000;
  }
}
```
**example2.com**
```
server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  listen [::]:443 ssl;
  server_name example2.com;
 
  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example2.com/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example2.com/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
  include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
  ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

  location / {
    proxy_pass https://router:60000;
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

That's it, a really handy trick to save money and use resources more efficiently for me and my self-hosting.

This, of course, only works with web apps. If your app isn't web-based, then you should look into SRV records. But they only work with applications and protocols who intend to use them.
