I never really liked Wuppertal. It's looking fine sometimes, but still the averge German city with way too much ugly concrete in it's center.

Though the people here can be quite creative:

I took some pictures of an event called “Lichterwege” *(ways of light, but sounding less holy)*. A city district once just decided to put up a lot of candles on the many stairs we got here.
