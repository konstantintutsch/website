In the last few month, I tried to write a decent web gallery to show off my photography on this website. I was never really happy with my implementations.

Yesterday, I realized that proper self-hosting solutions for photographers already exist. No need to code anything. Not in HTML nor in CSS *(okay, a bit of SQL was requiered)*.

After testing a few projects, I decided to settle on Lychee{% include reference.html id=1 %}. If you're interested, have a look at my *(currently pretty empty)* [gallery](/i)!
