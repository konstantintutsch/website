title: I'm forced to use a notes app that can't keep notes
description: At school we are obliged to use a specific notes app. That app loses data when it feels like it and there is no possibility to switch software.

About two years ago, our grade started using iPads instead of pen and paper. I still really appreciate that switch. No heavy books, empty pens or paper that needs to be replenished. We were free to use whichever app we liked to take our notes. I was pretty happy with the situation.

But for some reason, the school administration one day simply decided that we had to use a specific software. It makes sense first: every student has the same format, everything can be shared easily and younger students who aren't that responsible can be controlled better. That's what I thought at first.

There was just one small problem: the app that was chosen didn't work, at all. It freezes, loses data and is buggy. Not good for a fucking note-taking app. But I have to say that I'm impressed a little bit too: I've never experienced any other app freezing so often and having so many bugs. ðŸ¥²

I recently took notes in math class. In the next lesson, I wanted to read my notes. No chance, they were just gone. I asked a friend to send me his notes and everything was fine again. But that is just something that shouldn't happen. A notes app should be able to keep notes. *Notability*, avoid that app at all cost!

Of course you could now say that I'm an isolated case. But I have to disappoint you. I know at least two people who experienced the **exact** same. I can understand why a school forces the use of specific software. But I can't understand why you would choose such an inferior app.
