This is the first book of the trilogy "Remembrance of Earth's Past". It is somewhat of an introduction to the events that will take place. And therefore, I'm only now writing the post for this book because I'm almost done with all three books. It would have otherwise been difficult to rate the book.

The book is taking place on Earth, mostly China, but there are jumps back and forth between different points in time.

The story is not foreseeable and I was always wondering what could happen next and why something had happened. This unpredictability is one of the special features I really appreciate about the trilogy. Because of this, I recommend that you avoid spoilers at any cost if you'd like to read the trilogy in the future.

In the following days, I'll also write posts about the other two books.
