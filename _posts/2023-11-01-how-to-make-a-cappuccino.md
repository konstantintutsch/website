You probably don't want to drink cold coffee or waste time making it. To avoid that, you can prepare a few things.

First, pour the coffee powder into your portafilter:

Now, tamp the powder until it's reasonably compressed and insert the portafilter into your espresso machine.

Finally before we can start, fill your milk can with milk. To prevent wasting milk, use less than you would need to top up the cup.

Now that everything is prepared, we can start making your delicious cappuccino!

First, let the espresso machine brew an espresso.

Then, froth the milk and pour it into your espresso. You are done!
