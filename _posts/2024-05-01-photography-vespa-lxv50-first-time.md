Have you ever taken photos of a motorscooter or motocycle?

A friend of mine owns way too many of Piaggio's vehicles. This makes it easy for me to get my hands on a Vespa LXV50, like this one I photographed here.

This was the first time taking photos of a vehicle. Please let me know what you think could be improved!
