This is the second book of the trilogy "Remembrance of Earth's Past". After I had read the first book, I was already super excited for this one, but it even surpassed my expectations. I had problems getting myself to stop reading. The story was even more captivating.

This book continued the puzzel left behind by the [first book](/the-three-body-problem-novel). Most surprising, if I keep the puzzel anology, is that this puzzel feels complete, but it isn't. I always realised that I actually never had a full picture of the story, there were new events that I had never though of. I felt like I could predict the future of the story but I couldn't at all. Cixin Liu always completely astonished me with his ideas.

The author was also able to not overwhelm me with all the information. He describes a broad universe which should be impossible to keep an overview of. But Cixin Liu was able to not make me forget any of the different perspectives and protagonists.
