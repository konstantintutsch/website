This was another fantastic read. Even more confusing than [the first book]({% link _posts/2023-10-18-the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy.md %}) in the series.

The volume really helped me emerge into the series universe. It, again, was also quite good at indicating what's wrong with humanity in a really funny way. This book also amazed me with it's analogies.

But for some reason, I had problems reading more than 10 pages without a small break sometimes. I cannot say for sure why this happened, but I didn't enjoy it.

However, in conclusion this was a really great read. I have already bought the other three books of the series and am looking forward to reading them.
