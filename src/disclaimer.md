### Opinions

All expressed [opinions]({{ site.tags }}/opinion) on this site are my own. Aditionally, **my views are not permanent**. To improve, accepting new ideas and opinions is important.

Posts express my views from the time of writing them. These opinions *may* have changed since then. A post only is a snapshot of various thoughts of mine at the time I wrote it.

### Technical details

I sometimes publish technical posts. They describe a process which *worked for me* at the time of writing. They are not *the correct* way to archieve a certain goal. Before following along any of my technical posts, ensure that you have a basic understanding of the post's topic.

I can not be held liable for any damage to systems, data or else.
