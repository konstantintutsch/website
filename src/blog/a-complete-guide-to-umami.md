### What is Umami?

Umami is a self-hostable analytics platform. Like Google Analytics, but privacy preserving, open-source and without extreme tracking. You can have a look at [their website](https://umami.is/) if you're interested and want to learn more.

### Self-hostig on Linux

You can self-host Umami to ensure that all analytics data stays on your system and you have full control.

The Umami developers also provide a cloud solution you can subscribe to if you don't feel comfortable self-hosting.

#### Prerequisites

- NodeJS `(v18.17+)` + npm
- MySQL `(v5.7+)` or **PostgreSQL**<sup>used in this guide</sup> `(v12.14+)`
- Apache2 <sup>or your webserver of choice</sup>
- Certbot + webserver extension

#### Database setup

To initialize PostgreSQL, run this command on your system:

```
postgresql-setup
```

Enable and start PostgreSQL:

```
systemctl enable --now postgresql
```

Login to your database server:

```
sudo -u postgres psql
```

Umami needs a database. Create it like this:

```
CREATE DATABASE umami;
```

To ensure seperation between your databases, create a user for Umami:

```
CREATE USER umami WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'asecurepassword';
```

The user `umami` now needs permission to use the database `umami`. You can grant all necessary rights like this:

```
GRANT ALL ON DATABASE umami TO umami;
\c umami  -- enter database
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA PUBLIC TO umami;
```

You've now setup your database. Exit the SQL shell:

```
\q
```

#### Installation

Umami uses `yarn` for packaging. We need to install it first:

```
npm install -g yarn
```

Let's download Umami's source code and compile it:

```
cd /opt
```

```
git clone https://github.com/umami-software/umami.git
cd ./umami
```

```
yarn install
```

Before finally compiling Umami, create `/opt/umami/.env`:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://umami:asecurepassword@localhost:5432/umami
```

Build Umami:

```
yarn build
```

#### Running as a service

You definetly want to run Umami as a service. Follow these steps if your init system is SystemD.

Create a system user and group for Umami to use:

```
useradd -r -s /bin/bash -U -d /opt/umami umami
chown -R umami:umami /opt/umami
```

Add `umami.service` to `/etc/systemd/system/`:

```
[Unit]
Description=Umami Analytics
After=network.target postgresql.service

[Service]
User=umami
Group=umami
WorkingDirectory=/opt/umami
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/yarn run start
Restart=on-failure
ReadWritePaths=/opt/umami

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Finally, start and enable autostart for Umami:

```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now umami.service
```

#### Reverse proxy

Accessing Umami should happen via a secure connection on a standard port. We need a reverse proxy to archive this.

I'm running Fedora Server, so all website configuration will be saved to `/etc/httpd/conf.d/`. Other distributions often use `/etc/apache2/sites-available` and a link from `../sites-enabled`.

First, request a SSL certificate via Certbot:

```
certbot --apache -d analytics.konstantintutsch.com
```

Insert this configuration into `/etc/httpd/conf.d/umami.conf`:

```
<VirtualHost _default_:443>
    ServerName analytics.konstantintutsch.com
    ServerAdmin webmaster@konstantintutsch.com

    SSLEngine On
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/analytics.konstantintutsch.com/fullchain.pem
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/analytics.konstantintutsch.com/privkey.pem
    Include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-apache.conf

    <FilesMatch "\.(html?|txt|css|js)$">
        SetOutputFilter DEFLATE
    </FilesMatch>

    SSLProxyEngine Off
    SSLProxyVerify none 
    SSLProxyCheckPeerCN off
    SSLProxyCheckPeerName off
    SSLProxyCheckPeerExpire off

    <Location />
        ProxyPass http://localhost:3000/ retry=0
        ProxyPassReverse http://localhost:3000/
    </Location>
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName analytics.konstantintutsch.com
    Redirect permanent / https://analytics.konstantintutsch.com/
</VirtualHost>
```

#### Changing the default login

Now that your Umami instance is live, remove the default login via a browser.

{% image "umami-login.webp", "A login window asking for username and password", "This login window should appear on accessing your Umami instance" %}

Login with user `admin` and password `umami`.

{% image "umami-create-user.webp", "A window asking for username, password and role for a new user", "This is how the create user window looks like" %}

Once you've logged in, go to `your.instance/settings/users` and create a new user. Select `Administrator` as the role.

You can now logout and login with your new user. Navigate to the same page and delete the user `admin`.

Umami is setup. That's it! ðŸ¤©

#### Backup and restore

You only need to backup the database. We can use `pg_dump` to archive this.

```
sudo -u postgres pg_dump umami > /opt/umami.psql
```

Make sure to move `umami.psql` to multiple locations and to keep it inaccessible!

For restoring, reinstall Umami but don't login and stop Umami. Enter the SQL shell:

```
systemctl stop umami.service
sudo -u postgres psql
```

Delete your Umami database, create an empty one and regrant all rights:

```
DROP DATABASE umami;
CREATE DATABASE umami;
GRANT ALL ON DATABASE umami TO umami;
\c umami  -- enter database
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA PUBLIC TO umami;
```

Restore from your `umami.psql` dump:

```
sudo -u postgres psql umami < ./umami.psql
```

Your Umami instance has been restored. You can start it now ðŸ˜Œ

```
systemctl start umami.service
```

### Using Umami

This section is about using Umami's basic features.

You first need to add the website you want to track to Umami. Navigate to `your.instance/settings/websites` and add your website.

{% image "umami-add-website.webp", "A window asking for a name and domain to add a website", "This is how the add website window looks like" %}

Once you've added your website, click on the `Edit` button besides it's name. Navigate to the heading `Tracking code` in Umami's webinterface's tab bar. Add the `<script>` tag to your website's `<head>`.

{% image "umami-script.webp", "A page showing an HTML script tag and that it should be added to the head of your website" , "This is the page you're looking for" %}

If you also want to track which links, buttons or else are clicked on your website, you can add the `data-umami-event` attribute to them.

```
<a data-umami-event="social-github" href="https://github.com/konstantintutsch">GitHub</a>
```

Analytics are setup now too! That's it ðŸ¥³
