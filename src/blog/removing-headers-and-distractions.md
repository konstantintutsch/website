I've redesigned this website! 

Header, footer and everything that is unnecessarily distracting has been replaced or removed. This makes is less easy to navigate between pages, but I think it is worth it.

In my opinion, this more minimalist design increases the focus on the content and makes this website more pleasant to look at overall.

But let me know what you think! I might change it back.
