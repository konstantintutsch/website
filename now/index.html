<p class="description">What I'm currently doing! ⏳</p>

<article>
    <p><b><a href="{% link _tags/Book.md %}">Reading</a> 📑:</b> <i>Life, the Universe and Everything</i> 🛸 by <i>Douglas Adams</i>.</p>
    <p><b>Music 🎶:</b> I recently discovered <i>The Beatles</i> 📻 because of their new album <i>Now and Then</i>. I of course knew they existed, but had never really listened to one of their songs.</p>
    <p><b>Photography 📷:</b> I am considering buying a semi-professional camera to get started with photography!</p>
    <p><b>Learning how to learn 🤯:</b> Yeah, this is not a joke. I never have been in a position where I had to <i>really</i> learn something. I am preparing for the future where I will have to invest time in learning. 🧠</p>
    <p><b>Getting to know Fedora Linux 🐧:</b> I recently <a href="/gentoo-has-been-bugging-me/">moved away from Gentoo Linux</a> to Fedora. I am now leaning about Flatpak, SELinux, DNF and more.</p>
