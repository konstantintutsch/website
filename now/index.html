    <b>Reading 📑:</b> At the moment, I'm <a href="{% link _tags/Book.md %}">reading</a> <i>Life, the Universe and Everything</i> 🛸 by <i>Douglas Adams</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Music 🎶:</b> I recently discovered <i>The Beatles</i> 📻 because of their new album <i>Now and Then</i>. I of course knew they existed, but had never really listened to one of their songs.

    <b>Photography 📷:</b> I am considering buying a semi-professional camera to get started with photography!
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Learning how to learn 🤯:</b> Yeah, this is not a joke. I never have been in a position where I had to <i>really</i> learn something. I am preparing for the future where I will have to invest time in learning. 🧠
