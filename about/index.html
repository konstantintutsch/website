    Hi,<br>
    I'm Konstantin Tutsch ðŸ‘‹<br>
    <br>
    If you'd like to read more about me, just scroll down a bit.<br>

{% include heading.html level=3 text="Technology" %}

<p>
    I sometimes contribute to the Gentoo Linux project. If you are interested, you can check out my {% include social.html url="https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/proj/guru.git/log/?h=dev&qt=author&q=Konstantin+Tutsch" name="commits" %} to the GURU repository or visit my {% include social.html url="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:KonstantinTutsch" name="Wiki site" %}.<br>
    <br>
    Besides that, I self-host most of the services I use. In addition, it is only a single Raspberry Pi running all the self-hosted software, which keeps power consumption considerably low.<br>
    <br>
    But what I enjoy most about computers is programming. I am currently learning the C programming language.

    I like brewing and drinking coffee. My favourite methods of preperation are a <i>cappuccino</i> and an <i>espresso</i>.
