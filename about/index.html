Hi! 👋<br>
<br>
To start with a bit of an introduction, I am Konstantin and I live in Germany 🇩🇪.<br>
My current focus is learning programming.<br>
<br>
I, of course, am interested in more than that, just scroll down and read about those other interests if you like!<br>
You can subcribe to my posts via <a class="social" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/feed.rss">🗞️ RSS</a>.<br>

<h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
<p>
<h3>Technology</h3>
As you probably already guessed, I truly like technology.<br>
Tinkering with it, <i>breaking</i> it and discovering new stuff about it.<br>
<br>
But I'm not one of those people who use technology wisely, my OS is <i>Gentoo Linux</i>, which, indeed, is time comsuming in the worst possible moments. 😅<br>
I also <a class="social" target="_blank" rel="me noopener noreferrer" href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:KonstantinTutsch">contribute to Gentoo</a>.<br>
<br>
I also self-host everything that I need and requieres to be in the shape of a service. And I do all of that on a <b>single</b> Raspberry Pi (they are extremly powerful).<br>
<br>
What I really have to improve though, are my coding skills. You can check what I'm currently doing on <a class="social" target="_blank" rel="me noopener noreferrer" href="https://codeberg.org/konstantintutsch">💻 Codeberg</a>.<br>
<h3>Coffee</h3>
No, this is not an excuse for an extraordinary caffeine consumption, or is it? 🤪<br>
<br>
But I <b>really</b> like the brewing and drinking of it. My favourite methods of preperation are a <i>cappuccino</i> and an <i>espresso</i>.<br>
<br>
The stronger an espresso is, the more I like it.<br>
<h3>Reading</h3>
It's the best thing of which I ever convinced myself.<br>
<br>
I now read like an hour or so before going to bed every evening.<br>
This really improved my sleep. It moved me away from screens and it is <b>calming</b>.<br>
<br>
You now may ask yourself, <i>but what exactly is he reading?</i><br>
To that I say science fiction, mostly. But I also enjoy self-improvement and productivity books in between sometimes.<br>
<h3>Productivity</h3>
<i>Wake up a 5h00 and take an ice bath!</i><br>
<br>
No, I'm not one of those people.<br>
Although I do shower cold, but it has not only motivational benefits. It really is healthy.<br>
<br>
What I like is the idea of using time effectively and useful.<br>
But I am not just productive. Having fun <b>is</b> important and I definitly don't skip that. 😄<br>
</p>
<h2>How am I reading all this?</h2>
<p>
This site is written by myself, but <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> really helped my compile it together.<br>
<br>
My favourite font is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cantarell.gnome.org/">Cantarell</a> which you might recognize from GNOME. I use it for this site too, except for code blocks which are displayed with the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/">Hack</a> font.<br>
<br>
Here is my preferred color palette. It's quite good, at least in my opinion 🌚<br>
<ul>
 <li><span class="box white"></span>#ffffff</li>
 <li><span class="box black"></span>#000000</li>
 <li><span class="box blue"></span>#3584e4</li>
 <li><span class="box gray"></span>#d0cfcc</li>
</ul>
<br>
This site is hosted via managed hosting, <b>not</b> my Raspberry Pi, so I don't have to worry about it. <i>(4€/month incl. domain)</i><br>
