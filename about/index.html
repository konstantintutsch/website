<h2>About</h2>
<p>
{{ site.description }}
<h3>Technology</h3>
I sometimes contribute to the Gentoo Linux project. If you are interested, you can check out my {% include social.html url="https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/proj/guru.git/log/?h=dev&qt=author&q=Konstantin+Tutsch" name="commits" %} to the GURU repository or visit my {% include social.html url="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:KonstantinTutsch" name="Wiki site" %}.<br>
<br>
Besides that, I self-host most of the services I use. In addition, it is only a single Raspberry Pi running all the self-hosted software, which keeps power consumption considerably low.<br>
<br>
But what I enjoy most about computers is programming. I am currently learning the C programming language.<br>
<h3>Coffee</h3>
I like brewing and drinking coffee. My favourite methods of preperation are a <i>cappuccino</i> and an <i>espresso</i>.<br>
<h3>Reading</h3>
I mostly read science fiction. But I also enjoy self-improvement and productivity books sometimes.<br>
