<p id="description">
Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Konstantin Tutsch (from Germany). This is my personal website and blog.
</p>

{% include heading.html level=3 text="Interests & Hobbies" %}

<p>
This blog here is probably one of the most time consuming hobby of mine. I really enjoy how the posts preserve my opinions and thoughts. Also all the social interactions that the posts lead to.<br>
<br>
I am interested in technology. For example, I am currently learning the C programming language. I also contribute to Gentoo Linux. Drinking is also important, so I enjoy making a good cup of coffee. And finally, I read books.
</p>

<p>
I am a contributor to {% include social.html url="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:KonstantinTutsch" name="Gentoo Linux" %}. Besides that, I self-host most of the services I use. In addition, it is only a <a href="https://konstantintutsch.de/managed-hosting-and-rpi-only/#the-pi-lost-it-s-friend">single Raspberry Pi</a> running all the self-hosted software, which also keeps power consumption considerably low. But what I enjoy most about computers is programming. I am currently learning the C programming language.
</p>

<p>
I really like the preperation and drinking of coffee. My favourites are <i>cappuccino</i> and an <i>espresso</i>.
</p>

<p>
I mostly read science fiction. But I also enjoy self-improvement and productivity books sometimes. For every book I read, I post a small <a href="/Tag:Book">review</a> on this blog here.
</p>

<p>
I play tennis. Really fun with friends.
