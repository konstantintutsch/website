<p id="description">
Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Konstantin Tutsch. This is my personal website and blog.
</p>

{% include heading.html level=3 text="Interests & Hobbies" %}

<p>
This blog here is probably one of the most time consuming hobby of mine. I really enjoy how the posts preserve my opinions and thoughts. Also all the social interactions that the posts lead to.
</p>

{% include image.html file="RaspberryPi_Horizontal.webp" alt="A Raspberry Pi on top of a wooden tower. Connected are a SSD via USB-A, ethernet and power via USB-C." caption="My Raspberry Pi" %}

<p>
Technology is another great passion of mine. I am a contributor to {% include social.html url="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:KonstantinTutsch" name="Gentoo Linux" %}.
</p>

<p>
Besides that, I self-host most of the services I use. In addition, it is only a <a href="https://konstantintutsch.de/managed-hosting-and-rpi-only/#the-pi-lost-it-s-friend">single Raspberry Pi</a> running all the self-hosted software, which also keeps power consumption considerably low.
</p>

<p>
But what I enjoy most about computers is programming. I am currently learning the C programming language.

<p>
For my daily hydration, coffee is the go-to. I really like the preperation and taste of it. My favourites are <i><a href="{% link _posts/2023-11-01-how-to-make-a-cappuccino.md %}">cappuccino</a></i> and an <i>espresso</i>. I also drink a lot of water.
</p>

<p>
If I want to entertain myself, reading is great. I enjoy science fiction most, but I also read self-improvement and productivity books sometimes. For every book I read, I post a small <a href="/Tag:Book">review</a> on this blog here.
</p>

<p>
I also watch series and movies, my preferred 'universe' is Star Wars.
</p>

<p>
To stay fit, I play tennis. It is really fun with friends.
